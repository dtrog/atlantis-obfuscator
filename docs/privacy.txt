# Privacy Policy for Atlantis Obfuscator

Atlantis Obfuscator is an open-source web application hosted at [https://atlantis-obfuscator.onrender.com](https://atlantis-obfuscator.onrender.com). It is designed with user privacy in mind: **no personal data of users is collected or stored**. All input (code or text) you provide is used only transiently during the obfuscation process and is **not retained** after your session. The service uses **no cookies, analytics, or tracking mechanisms**. We also do **not share any information with third parties**. In short, Atlantis Obfuscator operates entirely with in-memory processing and does not engage in any form of user tracking or data collection.

Even though we collect no personal information, we provide this Privacy Policy as a best practice for transparency. The key privacy features are:

* **No Personal Data:** We do not collect, store, or process any personal or sensitive user information. The only data handled is the code/text you actively input for obfuscation.
* **No Cookies or Tracking:** The application uses **no cookies, analytics tools, or tracking**. Your usage is anonymous and untracked.
* **No Third-Party Sharing:** We do not share any user data with third parties. All processing is self-contained within the app.
* **Ephemeral Processing:** Any data you submit exists only in-session for obfuscation and is **not retained** once you leave or refresh the page.
* **No Retention Policies Needed:** Since we never store personal data, no data retention or deletion policies are necessary. No records are kept beyond your active session.

By using Atlantis Obfuscator at the link above, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. The **Data Controller** (the person responsible for this service and its data practices) is **Damien Trog**. Use of this service implies acceptance of these terms.
