    \ years ago, a fr iend and I walked around downtown Por tland at Chr istmas. \n\
    !\ne big depar tment stores: Meier and Fr ankÉ Fredr ic k and NelsonÉ NordstromsÉ\
    \ \ntheir big display windows eac h held a simple, prett y scene: a mannequin\
    \ wear ing c lothes \nor a per fume bottle sitting in fake snow. But the windows\
    \ at the J.J. Ne wberr y Õs store, \ndamn, the y were cr ammed with dol ls and\
    \ tinsel and spatulas and scre wdr iver sets and \npil lows, vacuum c leaners,\

    \ h of the hundreds of di\n\"\nerent objects was pr iced with a faded circ le\
    \ of red c ardboard. \nAnd walking past, my fr iend, L aur ie, took a long look\

    \ look quite r ight Ð put more inÕ. Ó \nS he said the per f ect comment at the\
    \ per f ect moment, and I remember it t wo dec ades \nlater bec ause it made me\
    \ laugh.\n!\nose other, prett y display windowsÉ I Õm sure the y were \nst y list\
    \ and tasteful, but I have no real memor y of how the y looked. \nFor this essay,\
    \ my goal is to put more in.To put together a kind-of Chr istmas \nstoc king of\
    \ ideas, with the hope that something wil l be useful. O r like pac king the gif\
    \ t \nboxes f or readers, putting in c andy and a squirrel and a book and some\
    \ toy s and a \nnec klace, I Õm hoping that enough var iet y wil l guar antee\
    \ that something here wil l occur as \ncompletel y asinine, but something else\
    \ might be per f ect.\nNumber One:\nTwo years ago, when I w rote the \n%\nrst\
    \ of these essay s it was about myÒegg timer \nmethod Ó of w r iting.You ne ver\
    \ saw that essay, but here Õs the method:W hen you donÕt \nwant to w r ite, set\
    \ an egg timer f or one hour (or half hour) and sit down to w r ite until the\
    \ \ntimer r ings. If you stil l hate w r iting, youÕre free in an hour. But usual\
    \ l y, by the time that \nalar m r ings, youÕ l l be so invol ved in your work,\
    \ enjoy ing it so muc h, youÕ l l keep going. \nInstead of an egg timer, you c\
    \ an put a load of c lothes in the washer or dr yer and use them \n102\n\nto time\
    \ your work. Alter nating the thoughtful task of w r iting with the mind less\
    \ work of \nlaundr y or dish washing wil l give you the breaks you need f or ne\
    \ w ideas and insights to \noccur. If you donÕt know what comes next in the stor\
    \ yÉ c lean your toilet. Change the bed \nsheets. For Chr ist sakes, dust the\
    \ computer. A better idea wil l come.\nNumberTwo:\nYour audience is smar ter than\
    \ you imagine. DonÕt be afr aid to exper iment with stor y \nf or ms and time\
    \ shif ts. My personal theor y is that younger readers distain most books Ð \n\
    not bec ause those readers are dumber than past readers, but bec ause today Õs\
    \ reader is \nsmar ter. Mo vies have made us ver y sophistic ated about stor y\
    \ tel ling. And your audience is \nmuc h harder to shoc k than you c an e ver\
    \ imagine. \nNumber\n!\nree:\nBef ore you sit down to w r ite a scene, mul l it\
    \ o ver in your mind and know the \npur pose of that scene.W hat ear lier set-ups\
    \ wil l this scene pay o\n\"\n?W hat wil l it set up f or \nlater scenes? How\
    \ wil l this scene fur ther your plot? As you work, dr ive, exercise, hold onl\
    \ y \nthis question in your mind.Take a f e w notes as you have ideas. And onl\
    \ y when youÕve \ndecided on the bones of the scene Ð then, sit and w r ite it.\
    \ DonÕt go to that bor ing, dust y \ncomputer without something in mind. And donÕt\
    \ make your reader slog through a scene \nin whic h little or nothing happens.\n\
    Number Four :\nS ur pr ise yourself. If you c an br ing the stor y Ð or let it\
    \ br ing you Ð to a place that \namaz es you, then you c an sur pr ise your reader.\n\
    !\ne moment you c an see any wel l-planned \nsur pr ise, c hances are, so wil\
    \ l your sophistic ated reader.\nNumber F ive:\n103\n\nW hen you get stuc k, go\
    \ bac k and read your ear lier scenes, looking f or dropped \nc har acters or\
    \ details that you c an resurrect asÒ bur ied guns. Ó At the end of w r iting\
    \ F ight \nClub, I had no idea what to do with the o\n&\nce building. But re-reading\
    \ the \n%\nrst scene, I \nf ound the throw-away comment about mixing nitro with\
    \ par a\n&\nn and how it was an i\n\"\ny \nmethod f or making plastic explosives.\n\
    !\nat sil l y aside (É par a\n&\nn has ne ver worked f or \nmeÉ) made the per\
    \ f ectÒ bur ied gunÓ to resurrect at the end and save my stor y tel ling ass.\n\
    Number S ix:\nUse w r iting as your excuse to throw a par t y eac h week Ð e ven\
    \ if you c al l that par t y a \nÒ workshop. Ó Any time you c an spend time among\
    \ other people who value and suppor t \nw r iting, that wil l balance those hours\
    \ you spend alone, w r iting. Even if someday you sel l \nyour work, no amount\
    \ of mone y wil l compensate you f or your time spent alone. S o, take \nyourÒpayc\
    \ hec kÓ up front, make w r iting an excuse to be around people.W hen you reac\
    \ h \nthe end of your lif e Ð tr ust me, you wonÕt look bac k and savor the moments\
    \ you spent \nalone.\nNumber S e ven:\nL et yourself be with Not Knowing.\n!\n\
    is bit of advice comes through a hundred \nfamous people, throughTom S panbauer\
    \ to me and now, you.\n!\ne longer you c an al low a \nstor y to take shape, the\
    \ better that \n%\nnal shape wil l be. DonÕt r ush or f orce the ending of a \n\
    stor y or book. Al l you have to know is the next scene, or the next f e w scenes.You\
    \ donÕt \nhave to know e ver y moment up to the end, in fact, if you do it Õ l\
    \ l be bor ing as hel l to \nexecute. \nNumber Eight:\nIf you need more freedom\
    \ around the stor y, dr af t to dr af t, c hange the c har acter \nnames. Char\
    \ acters arenÕt real, and the y arenÕt you. By ar bitr ar il y c hanging their\
    \ names, you \n104\n\nget the distance you need to real l y tor ture a c har acter.\
    \ O r worse, delete a c har acter, if \nthat Õs what the stor y real l y needs.\n\
    Number Nine:\n!\nere are three t y pes of speec h Ð I donÕt know if this isT RUE,\
    \ but I heard it in a \nseminar and it made sense.\n!\ne three t y pes are: Descr\

    \ w r iters wil l onl y use one Ð at most, t wo Ð of these f or ms. S o use al\
    \ l three. \nMix them up. It Õs how people talk.\nNumberTen:\nWr ite the book\
    \ you want to read.\nNumber Ele ven:\nGet author book jac ket photos taken now,\
    \ while youÕre young. And get the negatives \nand copy r ight on those photos.\n\
